# Ansible

## What is it good for?

Ansible as a **configuration management** tool can be used to describe and enforce the state for our machines: the right
packages are installed, configuration files contain the expected values and have the expected permissions, the right services
are running, and so on.

Ansible as a **deployment** tool can generate binaries or static assets, copy the required files to the servers and then
starting up the services.

Ansible as a tool for **orchestration** of deployment can perform actions on multiple servers and enforce a specific order
between these actions.

Ansible as a tool for **provisioning** new servers can interact with different cloud providers (EC2, Azure, Digital Ocean,
Google Compute Engine, Linode, and ackspace) to spin up new virtual machines.
