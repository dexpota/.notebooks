# Permissions

## Overview

An app must publicize the permissions it requires by including
`<uses-permission>` tags in the app manifest.

If your app lists **normal** permissions in its manifest, the system
automatically grants those permissions to your app.

If your app lists dangerous permissions in its manifest, the user must
explicitly agree to grant those permissions.
