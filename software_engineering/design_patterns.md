# Design Patterns

## Strategy

**What**. Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them
interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from the
clients that use it.

**How**. Capture the abstraction in an interface, bury implementation details
in derived classes.
