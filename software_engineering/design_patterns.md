## Strategy

> [Reference](https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns/strategy)

- The *Strategy* pattern gives you the ability to define a family of algorithms,
encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable.

- *Strategy* reduces the *coupling* between the clients and the algorithms. The
algorithm can vary independently from the clients that use it.

- The pattern capture the abstraction in an interface, and bury the
  implementation details in derived classes.
