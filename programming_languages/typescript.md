# Typescript

TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
It offers classes, modules, and interfaces to help you build robust components.

## Installation

You will need to install the TypeScript compiler either globally or in your
workspace to transpile TypeScript source code to JavaScript.

```bash
# install typescript globally
npm -g install typescript
```

```bash
# install typescript locally to your project
npm install typescript
```
